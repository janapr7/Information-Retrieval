Clinton to Trump: Do your job!\r\nDavid Jackson\r\nUSA TODAY\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON – Engaging in a favorite pastime, President Donald Trump taunted Hillary Clinton and the 2020 Democratic candidates on Tuesday by saying she should run for the White House again – only to have Clinton taunt back.\r\n\r\n\"Don’t tempt me,\" she tweeted at Trump. \"Do your job.\"\r\n\r\nShe was responding to an earlier post in which Trump said: \"I think that Crooked Hillary Clinton should enter the race to try and steal it away from Uber Left Elizabeth Warren.\"\r\n\r\nHe also listed one \"condition\" of her renewed candidacy, saying Clinton should disclose the reason she deleted emails from her time as secretary of State for President Barack Obama.\r\n\r\nClinton responded a few hours later with her own taunting tweet.\r\n\r\nTrump\'s hit came as he as under impeachment investigation for asking Ukraine\'s president to investigate another Democratic presidential candidate, former Vice President Joe Biden.'),
(2,'TRUMP: DON’T TALK TO ME ABOUT UKRAINE, HILLARY CLINTON IS THE REAL CRIMINAL HERE\r\nThe president wants his 2016 opponent to run in 2020 so they can debate her crimes.\r\n\r\n\r\nBY BESS LEVIN\r\nOCTOBER 8, 2019\r\nUS Democratic Presidential nominee Hillary Clinton  and Republican Presidential nominee Donald Trump participate a town...\r\nBY SAUL LOEB/AFP/GETTY IMAGES.\r\nSince being accused of pressuring Ukraine to dig up dirt on Joe Biden as part of a quid pro quo deal for nearly $400 million in military aid and a White House visit, Donald Trump has responded to the charges in a variety of unhinged ways, none of which constitute actual legal defenses. He’s insisted that the whistle-blower is fake news because the person didn’t have firsthand knowledge of the call with Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelensky, despite the fact that the phone call summary in the complaint closely mirrored the rough readout of the conversation released by the White House itself. He’s suggested that Rep. Adam Schiff be tried for treason and Senator Mitt Romney be impeached. He’s scared the crap out of the prime minister of Finland, who will probably never return to the United States on account of lingering trauma. And, of course, he’s reached back into the dumpster of his brain to revive a favorite 2016 rallying call: that he did nothing wrong and the real criminal here is Hillary Clinton.\r\n\r\n“I think that Crooked Hillary Clinton should enter the race to try and steal it away from Uber Left Elizabeth Warren,” Trump tweeted one day after claiming to possess “great and unmatched wisdom,” his characteristic capitalization choices giving the impression that the senator from Massachusetts had scored that coveted Uber Technologies endorsement. “Only one condition. The Crooked one must explain all of her high crimes and misdemeanors including how & why she deleted 33,000 Emails AFTER getting ‘C’ Subpoena!”\r\n\r\nOf course, it’s not at all surprising that Trump, under the gun for abusing the power of the presidency in numerous ways, would turn to the “but her emails!” defense, a favorite go-to for Republicans whenever their Lord and Savior is backed into a corner, despite the fact that Emailgate was settled by the FBI three years ago. The old Clinton deflection has surfaced a handful of times since Republicans opened their impeachment inquiry, including this past weekend, when the president tweeted, “so Crooked Hillary Clinton can delete and acid wash 33,000 emails AFTER getting a Subpoena from the United States Congress, but I can’t make one totally appropriate telephone call to the President of Ukraine? Witch Hunt!”\r\n\r\nSeparately, other former members of the Trump orbit have put forth Clinton-related suspicions of their own. Earlier this month, the decomposing corpse of Steve Bannon, who refuses to disappear back into the putrid bog from whence he came, served up the bold claim that Clinton was planning to run in 2020, despite the fact that the chances of such a turn of events are about as likely as Trump tweeting later today, “I realize now that my actions concerning Biden and Ukraine were beyond the pale, and I will cooperate with any investigation into the matter.”\r\n\r\nUpdate: Several hours later, Clinton weighed in on the idea:'),

Those questions have been stoked by Clinton herself, who responded to a recent Trump tweet about her running again by simply saying, \"Don\'t tempt me,\" and joked with PBS\' Judy Woodruff about a possible round two with the President.\r\n\r\nSponsor content by Dubai Tourism\r\nExplore where the beginnings of Dubai were born\r\nJoin Gwyneth, Kate and Zoe as they each experience a different story of Dubai. Watch as their journeys unfold, each discovering the city in different ways.\r\n\"Maybe there does need to be a rematch,\" Clinton said jokingly. \"Obviously, I can beat him again.\" Clinton bested Trump in the popular vote, but fell short in the Electoral College.\r\nBut Clinton\'s reemergence is more a product of fortuitous timing and feeling unencumbered than a genuine exploration of a 2020 run.\r\n\"No,\" said longtime Clinton friend and former Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, when asked if Clinton is considering a run in 2020. \"I think she is having the time of her life and speaking her mind.\"\r\nMcAuliffe, who was chair of Clinton\'s 2008 presidential campaign, added: \"It drives Trump crazy. ... Trump and his massive ego cannot get over the fact that Hillary Clinton got 3 million more votes than he got. It drives him absolutely mad, so she is having fun shooting back at him.\"\r\nFor Clinton, the moment is a twofold opportunity: promoting her book and taunting Trump. And friends who have spent time with her in recent weeks say she\'s enjoying both in equal measures.\r\n\"Yes, she loves taunting him. As much now as ever,\" a person close to Clinton told CNN, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations. \"She\'s having fun, but that doesn\'t mean she\'s going to run again.\"\r\nClinton, after writing \"The Book of Gutsy Women: Favorite Stories of Courage and Resilience\" with her daughter, Chelsea Clinton, was always planning a lengthy book tour. Little did she know, however, that she would kick off the tour mere hours before House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced the beginning of an impeachment inquiry into Trump.\r\nThat unexpected timing, aides said, meant Clinton was going to be far more public at the same time that Trump\'s presidency faced its most existential threat. Trump continues to bring up Clinton, tweeting about her regularly and often using questions around her email use as secretary of state to deflect from questions about his own legal issues.\r\nNick Merrill, Clinton\'s longtime spokesman, said the former nominee is \"not going to take (Trump\'s attacks) lying down.\"\r\n\"She is out on a book tour,\" Merrill said, \"and she is having a little fun.\"\r\nOne longtime loyal supporter said Clinton\'s jabs at Trump have created a fear among those close to her that she could ultimately consider a rematch, which many people believe would end badly for her.\r\n\"A lot of people are talking to her, which isn\'t helpful,\" another person close to Clinton told CNN. \"They get into her head because she so dislikes Donald Trump that she can\'t see straight.\"\r\nAll of this chatter -- much of which comes from longtime Clinton donors -- is focused on the notion of a rematch with Trump. Of course, should she decide to run -- again, highly unlikely -- she would face a Democratic primary fight in a far different landscape than the 2016 campaign.\r\n\"Sure, she thinks about it,\" said McAuliffe of another Clinton presidential run, \"but she is also realistic.\"\r\nStill, some friends email her political gambling sites, showing her with a strong chance of defeating Trump. Newspaper columns floating the idea of her running always make their way into her inbox, including one last week from former San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown.\r\n\"She feels vindicated on everything she felt during the campaign,\" a person close to Clinton said. \"She\'s been proven right. Does that mean she will run again? No.\"\r\nA longtime confidante put it more bluntly: \"She is NOT running.\"\r\nClinton has, however, been directly involved with the 2020 race and is deeply immersed in its day-to-day machinations. She keeps up with the swirl of news around the large field of Democrats vying to take on Trump and, according to advisers, has talked to nearly all of the 2020 Democrats.\r\nThat includes recent conversations with former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, the race\'s two front-runners, as well as in-person meetings with candidates like Sen. Kamala Harris of California, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and others. Clinton has not talked to Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, an adviser said, who is running for the nomination again after challenging Clinton in 2016.\r\nWhile Clinton has been involved in the 2020 primary behind the scenes, she does not plan to endorse in the contest, people close to her said.\r\nClinton\'s recent bluntness has been a stark break from how she was as a candidate in 2016, where she was more guarded and careful.\r\nThis shift was recently made clear when, during a book tour interview, Clinton replied to a question about the gutsiest thing she ever did with an answer that took even some of her advisers by surprise.\r\n\"I think the gutsiest thing I\'ve ever done -- well, personally -- make the decision to stay in my marriage,\" Clinton told ABC, referring to her husband, then-President Bill Clinton, having an affair with then-White House intern Monica Lewinsky in the 1990s.\r\n\"She feels unconstrained, free to speak her mind,\" said Merrill. \"Watch her on this book tour. It\'s liberating.\"\r\nThis story has been updated with Hillary Clinton\'s tweet from Thursday.');
